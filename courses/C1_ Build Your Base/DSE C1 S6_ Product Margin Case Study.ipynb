It is also used to estimate whether the median of any two independent samples are equal. Therefore, Mood’s median non parametric hypothesis test is an alternative to the one-way ANOVA. This test works when dependent variable is continuous or discrete-count, and the independent variables are discrete with two or more attributes.\n","\n","Mood’s median test is a primitive two sample version of sign test. This test can be applied for more than two samples, but it is not as powerful as Kruskal-Wallis Test.\n","\n","While Mood’s median test is more useful for smaller sample sizes, when the data contains few outliers, because this test is only focuses on median value instead of ranks.\n","\n","Usually the researchers prefers Wilcoxon Rank Sum test or Mann-Whitney U test as they provides more robust
