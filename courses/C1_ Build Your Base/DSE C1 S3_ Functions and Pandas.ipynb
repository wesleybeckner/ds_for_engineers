The group by documentation is [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html).  Basically, `groupby` allows us to create *groups* of records based on their values. Let's count how many records, or rows, in our data set fall into each bin of our CRIM data.
