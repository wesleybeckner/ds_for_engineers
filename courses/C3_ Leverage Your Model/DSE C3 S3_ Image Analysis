There are many application-centric subdomains of machine learning and this is one of them (another would be natural language processing). Whereas we may imagine a natural language processing task may be super relevant to say, a paralegal, the area of image analysis is particularly relevant to engineers. We can use the power of image related machine learning to replace, augment, or optimize what would typically be reserved for a human agent on the factory floor. \r\n","\r\n","<br>\r\n","\r\n","---\r\n","\r\n","<br>\r\n","\r\n","<a name='top'></a>\r\n","\r\n","# Contents\r\n","\r\n","* 3.0 [Preparing Environment and Importing Data](#x.0)\r\n","  * 3.0.1 [Import Packages](#x.0.1)\r\n","  * 3.0.2 [Load Dataset](#x.0.2)\r\n","* 3.1 [Image Processing in Python with scikit-image](#x.1)\r\n","* 3.2 [Images as Arrays](#x.2)\r\n","* 3.3 [Local Operators](#x.3)\r\n","  * 3.3.1 [Linear Filtering](#x.3.1)\r\n","  * 3.3.2 [Gaussian Filtering](#x.3.2)\r\n","* 3.4 [Feature Engineering](#x.4)\r\n","  * 3.4.1 [HOG-SVM](#x.4.1)\r\n","  * 3.4.2 [Color to Grayscale](#x.4.2)\r\n","  * 3.4.3 [Normalization](#x.4.3)\r\n","  * 3.4.4 [Image Augmentation with Keras](#x.4.4)\r\n","* 3.5 [Training and Testing with an SGD Classifier](#x.5)\r\n","* 3.6 [Model Evaluation](#x.6)\r\n","  \r\n","\r\n","<br>\r\n","\r\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mNtJitcRW51Y"},"source":["<a name='x.0'></a>\r\n","\r\n","## 3.0 Preparing Environment and Importing Data\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"chdcBoBL8SNm"},"source":["<a name='x.0.1'></a>\r\n","\r\n","### 3.0.1 Import Packages\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"R7vDY-8U8SWd"},"source":["<a name='x.0.1'></a>\r\n","\r\n","### 3.0.2 Load Dataset\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"062Czp9-rBOi"},"source":["<a name='x.1'></a>\r\n","\r\n","## 3.1 Image Processing in Python with scikit-image\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wlj85iTSIwji"},"source":["<a name='x.2'></a>\r\n","\r\n","## 3.2 Images as Arrays\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2p4qhOHy4BCP"},"source":["<a name='x.3'></a>\r\n","\r\n","## 3.3 Local Operators\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CXgU8de-9AVU"},"source":["<a name='x.3.1'></a>\r\n","\r\n","### 3.3.1 Linear Filtering\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FFWFQP0r9Ab3"},"source":["<a name='x.3.2'></a>\r\n","\r\n","### 3.3.2 Gaussian Filtering\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pvZsrqIK9AiT"},"source":["<a name='x.4'></a>\r\n","\r\n","## 3.4 Feature Engineering\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bMPLoKMTnsZm"},"source":["<a name='x.4.1'></a>\r\n","\r\n","### 3.4.1 HOG-SVM\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ohEztRNLn8WD"},"source":["<a name='x.4.2'></a>\r\n","\r\n","### 3.4.2 Color to Grayscale\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CQumxj-Qn88a"},"source":["<a name='x.4.3'></a>\r\n","\r\n","### 3.4.3 Normalization\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ngRr88sYn9Tg"},"source":["<a name='x.4.4'></a>\r\n","\r\n","### 3.4.4 Image Augmentation with Keras\r\n","\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3VzFBkjRoMLI"},"source":["<a name='x.5'></a>\r\n","\r\n","## 3.5 Training and Testing with an SGD Classifier\r\n","[back to top](#top)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eCqlOJwboNKJ"},"source":["<a name='x.6'></a>\r\n","\r\n","## 3.6 Model Evaluation\r\n","[back to top](#top)\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1o9ATkGp3-OR"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
